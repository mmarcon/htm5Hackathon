#City Sounds and Flying Hamsters

Created during the @5apps_ HTML5 hackathon Saturday 5th â€“ Sunday 6th May 2012.

 **PUT ON YOUR HEADPHONES!**

Generate a soundscape of the area you're looking at on the map then fly around it.

##How to run the demo
First of all clone the Git repository:

    git clone git://github.com/mmarcon/htm5Hackathon.git

The demo requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and Express. We implemented a little HTTP server that serves the application and at as a proxy to Deezer as the MP3s hosted in their CDN are not served with the cross-origin flag.

If Express is not already installed:

    npm install express

Then

    cd node
    node proxy.js
    
Now just point your browser to `http://localhost:8000`, plug in your headphones and enjoy.
The hamster can be controlled with arrow keys, space generates a soundscape for the current area.
